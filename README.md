# ODang
The ODang language by Charles Dang, Giovanni Orozco and Marius Larnøy for Comp 430 CSUN  
Language Design Proposal: ODANG  
Student Names: Charles Dang, Giovanni Orozco, Marius Larnøy  
Language Name: ODANG  
Compiler Implementation Language and Reasoning: Java. We already know how to code in Java.
Target Language: Javascript  
Language Description:  Object-oriented programming. We’re going to create a Java-like language that is more optimized and useful.  
Planned Restrictions: No garbage collection.  

Computation Abstraction Non-Trivial Feature: Object-oriented classes  
Non-Trivial Feature #2: Subtyping  
Non-Trivial Feature #3: Operator Overloading  
Work Planned for Custom Component: Subtyping will be left for the end since we need object-oriented classes implemented first
